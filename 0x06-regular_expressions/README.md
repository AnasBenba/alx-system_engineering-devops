# Regular Expressions (Regex)

Regular expressions, commonly referred to as regex or regexp, are powerful patterns used for matching and manipulating text. They are supported by many programming languages and tools and are widely used in various applications such as text processing, data validation, search, and more. This README provides a brief introduction to regular expressions, their syntax, and common use cases.

## Basic Syntax

A regular expression consists of a pattern of characters that define a search pattern. It can include literal characters, metacharacters, and special characters. Here's a basic syntax example:

```
/pattern/
```

In many programming languages, regular expressions are enclosed between delimiters such as forward slashes ("/"). The pattern can be written between these delimiters to define the desired search pattern.

## Metacharacters

Metacharacters are special characters with reserved meanings in regular expressions. They allow you to define more complex patterns. Some common metacharacters include:

- `.` (dot): Matches any single character except newline.
- `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
- `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
- `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.
- `|` (pipe): Acts as an OR operator, allowing multiple alternatives.
- `[]` (square brackets): Defines a character class, matching any single character within the brackets.

## Character Classes

Character classes allow you to match specific sets of characters. They are defined using square brackets. Some examples include:

- `[0-9]`: Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
- `[a-z]`: Matches any lowercase letter.
- `[A-Z]`: Matches any uppercase letter.
- `[aeiou]`: Matches any vowel.
You can also use negation within character classes by adding a caret (^) at the beginning, such as `[^0-9]` to match any character that is not a digit.

## Quantifiers

Quantifiers define the number of occurrences that should be matched. They can be applied to a character, metacharacter, or a group. Some common quantifiers include:

- `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences.
- `+`: Matches one or more occurrences.
- `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence.
- `{n}`: Matches exactly n occurrences.
- `{n,}`: Matches at least n occurrences.
- `{n,m}`: Matches at least n and at most m occurrences.
For example, the pattern `a+` matches one or more consecutive occurrences of the letter "a."

## Anchors

Anchors are used to match positions in a string rather than specific characters. Some commonly used anchors include:

- `^`: Matches the start of a string or line.
- `$`: Matches the end of a string or line.
- `\b`: Matches a word boundary.
For instance, the pattern `^abc` matches the string "abc" only if it appears at the beginning of a line or string.

## Grouping and Capturing

Groups are portions of the pattern enclosed in parentheses. They allow you to apply quantifiers or modifiers to multiple characters at once. Additionally, groups can be used for capturing matched substrings for further processing. For example:

- `(abc)`: Matches the sequence "abc."
- `(abc|def)`: Matches either "abc" or "def."
Captured groups can be referenced later using backreferences, typically represented as `\1`, `\2`, etc.

## Modifiers

Modifiers or flags are optional settings that can be applied to a regular expression. They alter the behavior of the pattern matching process. Some common modifiers include:

- `i`: Case-insensitive matching.
- `g`: Global matching (find all matches, not just the first one).
- `m`: Multi-line matching.
Modifiers are usually specified after the closing delimiter of the regular expression, like `/pattern/i`

## Common Use Cases

Regular expressions find applications in various domains, including:

- `Form validation`: Regex can be used to validate input data, such as email addresses, phone numbers, or passwords, to ensure they adhere to specific patterns.
- `Text search and manipulation`: Regex allows searching and replacing patterns in text, making it useful for tasks like find and replace, data extraction, and parsing.
- `URL routing`: Regular expressions can be used in web frameworks to define URL patterns and map them to appropriate handlers.
- `Data scraping`: When extracting data from websites, regex can help locate and extract specific information from HTML or text documents.
- `Log analysis`: Regex enables filtering and extracting relevant information from log files based on specific patterns or criteria.
Note that regular expressions can become complex, and writing efficient and robust patterns may require practice and testing.
